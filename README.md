## Introduction
PixelPilot is an Android app packaging multiple pieces together to decode an H264/H265 video feed broadcast by wfb-ng over the air.

- [FPVue_android](https://github.com/gehee/FPVue_android): basic and unique work to combine all components into a single application by [Gee He](https://github.com/gehee).
- [devourer](https://github.com/openipc/devourer): userspace rtl8812au driver initially created by [buldo](https://github.com/buldo) and converted to C by [josephnef](https://github.com/josephnef).
- [LiveVideo10ms](https://github.com/Consti10/LiveVideo10ms): excellent video decoder from [Consti10](https://github.com/Consti10) converted into a module.
- [wfb-ng](https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng): library allowing the broadcast of the video feed over the air.

The wfb-ng [gs.key](https://github.com/OpenIPC/PixelPilot/raw/main/app/src/main/assets/gs.key) is embedded in the app.
The settings menu allows selecting a different key from your phone.

Supported rtl8812au wifi adapter are listed [here](https://github.com/OpenIPC/PixelPilot/blob/main/app/src/main/res/xml/usb_device_filter.xml).
Feel free to send pull requests to add new supported wifi adapters hardware IDs.

Now support saving a dvr of the video feed to `Files/Internal Storage/Movies/`
